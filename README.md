# Magnetic-Ball-Suspension-System
• Linearized the magnetic ball suspension system to derive its small-signal transfer function.

• Designed a robust 2-DoF controller achieving <2s settling time and <5% overshoot.

• Validated performance through MATLAB simulations comparing 1-DoF and 2-DoF strategies.

• Tuned control gains for precise tracking and enhanced stability.
